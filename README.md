<b><p style="color:tomato; font-family:agency fb; font-size:50px;" id='What Is Addiction?'>What Is Addiction?</p></b>

<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">A person with an addiction uses a substance, or engages in a behavior, for 
which the rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeat the activity, despite detrimental consequences. Addiction may involve the
use of substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, and nicotine, or behaviors such as gambling.
<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">There is evidence that addictive behaviors share key neurobiological features: 
They intensely involve brain pathways of reward and reinforcement, which involve the neurotransmitter dopamine. And, in keeping with other highly
motivated states, they lead to the pruning of synapses in the prefrontal cortex, home of the brain's highest functions, so that attention is highly 
focused on cues related to the target substance or activity. It is important to know that such brain changes are reversible after the substance use 
or behavior is discontinued.</p>

<p style="color:tomato; font-family:agency fb; font-size:35px;">What is video game addiction</p>

<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">Video game addiction is the repetitive, prolonged, compulsive playing of video games 
to the point where the person playing is unable to stop or reduce their gaming despite related negative consequences. A person may be diagnosed 
with video game addiction when their gaming behavior is severe enough to impair their career and education, family and social lives, and other important life areas for at least 12 months.</p>
<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">Not everyone who plays video games for extended periods is necessarily at risk for gaming 
addiction. However, those who do play video games should remain aware of the amount of time they are spending on gaming to prevent their behavior 
from cutting into other activities and important obligations. Gamers should also stay aware of any adverse changes in their health and social 
functioning that may be caused by gaming so they can get professional help when needed, or take the appropriate steps to cut back on gameplay and 
prevent the onset of serious negative consequences.</p>

<p style="color:tomato; font-family:agency fb; font-size:35px;">What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Video Game Addiction

<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">Those who suffer from video game addiction tend to prioritize video games above all 
other activities, tasks and obligations, including personal hygiene, their job, their family, and education. Video game addiction shares many 
of the same traits, signs, and symptoms of other behavioral addictions, and can worsen the state of your physical, emotional, and psychological 
health.</p>



<b><p style="color:tomato; font-family:agency fb; font-size:50px;" id='Myths about  Addiction'>Myths about Addiction</p></b>


<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">The processes that give rise to addictive behavior resist a simplistic explanation. 
There is not just one cause: Although genetic or other biological factors can contribute to a person vulnerability to the condition, many social, 
psychological, and environmental factors also have a powerful influence on substance use.
Some characteristics, such as a lack of ability to tolerate distress or other strong feelings, have been associated with addiction, but 
there is no one addictive personality type that clearly predicts whether a person will face problems with addiction.

<b><p style="color:tomato; font-family:agency fb; font-size:50px;" id='Symptoms of Addiction'>Symptoms of Addiction</p></b>


<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">Recurrent use of a substance, or engagement with an activity, that leads to impairment or 
distress, is the core of addictive disorders. The clinical diagnosis of an addiction is based on the presence of at least two of a number of 
features:
The substance or activity is used in larger amounts or for a longer period of time than was intended.
There is a desire to cut down on use or unsuccessful efforts to do so.
Pursuit of the substance or activity, or recovery from its use, consumes a significant amount of time.
There is a craving or strong desire to use the substance or engage in the activity.
Use of the substance or activity disrupts obligations at work, school, or home.
Use of the substance or activity continues despite the social or interpersonal problems it causes.
Participation in important social, work, or recreational activities drops or stops.
Use occurs in situations where it is physically risky.
Use continues despite knowing it is causing or exacerbating physical or psychological problems.
Tolerance occurs, indicated either by need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect or markedly diminished 
effect of the same amount of substance.
Withdrawal occurs, manifest either in the presence of physiological withdrawal symptoms or the taking of a related substance to block them.
The severity of the condition is gauged by the number of symptoms present. The presence of two to three symptoms generally indicates a mild 
condition; four to five symptoms indicate a moderate disorder. When six or more symptoms are present, the condition is considered severe.

<p style="font-family:agency fb; font-size:25px;">Substance use is a treatable condition and complete remission is entirely possible. Recovery, 
however, is often a long-term process that may involve multiple attempts. Relapse is now regarded as part of the process, and effective treatment 
regimens address prevention and management of recurrent use.
Since success tends not to occur all at once, any improvements are considered important signs of progress. Increasingly, programs are available 
to help those who recognize that they have a substance-use problem but are not ready for complete abstinence.
Because addiction affects so many facets of an individual functioning from the ability to tolerate frustration to establishing and maintaining a 
productive role in society good treatment focuses on many dimensions of life, including family roles and work skills as well as mental health.
Treatment can include any of a number of components, which are often deployed in combination and are likely to change over the course of recovery
Detoxification, conducted under medical supervision, may be needed but is only the first stage of treatment.
Medications that reduce or counter use of illicit substances are suitable for some individuals, or medications may be used to target co-occurring 
disorders such as anxiety and depression.
Motivational Interviewing, which is a short-term counseling process to help a person resolve ambivalence about treatment and find and hold onto 
incentives for change.
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) can help a person recognize and cope with situations that trigger the desire to use substances.
Group therapy and other peer-support programs leverage the direct experience of many to support individual recovery and prevent the recurrence of 
substance use.
Family therapy helps individuals repair any damage done to family relationships and to establish more supportive ones.
Life skills training, including employability skills, may be part of an individual treatment plan.
Good treatment programs also feature the regular monitoring of individual progress.
Treatment is available in a variety of settings, from a doctor office or outpatient clinic to long-term residential facility. No one way will be 
right for everyone, and there is evidence that one's commitment to change is more important than the type of treatment program he or she selects. 
Whatever the treatment under consideration, say independent researchers, there are number of features to look for to identify an effective program:
Patients undergo comprehensive medical and psychiatric screening.
Treatment addresses individual needs, including co-occurring conditions, whether chronic pain, anxiety, or hepatitis.
Families are involved in treatment.
There is continuity of care via active linkages to resources in subsequent phases of recovery.
The facility maintains a respectful environment.
Treatment services are evidence-based and reflect best practices.
Staff members are licensed and certified in the disciplines they practice.
The program is accredited by a nationally recognized monitoring agency.
Patient response to treatment is monitored and the program or facility offers outcome data reflecting treatment performance.</p>
